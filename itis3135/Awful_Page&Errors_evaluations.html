            <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org" target="_blank">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <p>Craigslist is an ads platform where users can post listings for various items and services.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contrast: The white background with black and blue text doesn't stand out much, which may make it a little harder to navigate for some users.</li>
              <li>Repetition: Adding more design elements could give the layout a more organized feel.</li>
              <li>Alignment: There's some unused space, and a few parts feel a bit crowded, which can make it hard to focus on certain sections.</li>
              <li>Proximity: Links and categories are placed quite closely, which may make it harder to tell different sections apart.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, the site could benefit from improved CRAP principles to enhance its visual structure and user experience.</p>
